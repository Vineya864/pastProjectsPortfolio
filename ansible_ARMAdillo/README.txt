ARMAdillo:
Ansible README Assistant
this python program looks through an ansible role and creates a README that can be used to help explain its purpose.

It can be tiresome to go through undocumented ansible roles to try and understand what the role is supposed to be doing. The ansible ARMAdillo 
will search throught the roles files and create a readme that can be used to help understand what the role was for and what it may be doing.

Obviously this can also be used to quickly create a README file for your own roles. Please do not use this script as a substitue for full documentation
