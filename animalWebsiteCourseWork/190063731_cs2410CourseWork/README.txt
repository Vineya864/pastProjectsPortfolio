Second Year course work.
The objective was to create a working website that could be used by an animal adoption agency to show and record animals and adoption requests.
It used html css and java script to creat the main pages and then php to allow interaction with the server and desplay some information. SQL was used to send requests to the database.

.create an account 
.view animals
.submit addoption requests.

.view animals
.create admin accounts
.submit addoption requests
.view adoption requests
.decline and accept adoption requests.
.add animals to be displayed
