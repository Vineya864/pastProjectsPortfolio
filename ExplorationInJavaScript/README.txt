Aston hack2021 project.
The aim of the project was to see how far I could go only using java script. I used html and css to create the page that the game runs on but otherwise set out to only use javascript.
I wanted to spend time refining my javascript abilities and this hackathon seemed like a good chance to do that. I used sprites that were created for the survival space game before it was 
converted to a 3d game.
